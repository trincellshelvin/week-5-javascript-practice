      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>
